abstract: The ability to coordinate finger forces to dexterously perform tasks
  develops in children as they grow older. Following brain injury, either
  developmental (as in cerebral palsy–CP) or acquired (as in traumatic brain
  injury—TBI), this developmental trajectory will likely be impaired. In this
  study, we compared finger coordination in a group of children aged 4–12 with
  CP and TBI to a group of typically developing children using an isometric
  pressing task. As expected, deficits were observed in functional tests (Jebsen
  Taylor test of hand function, Box and Block test) for both groups, and
  children in both groups performed the pressing task less well than the control
  group. However, differing results were observed between the CP and TBI groups
  when using the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis to look at the synergy index.
  This index measures the relative amount of “good” (does not affect the outcome
  measure) and “bad” (does affect the outcome measure) variability, where in
  this case the outcome measure is the total force produced by the fingers.
  While children with CP were more variable in their performance, their synergy
  index was not significantly different from typically developing children,
  suggesting the development of compensatory strategies. In contrast, the
  children following TBI showed performance that got worse as a function of age
  (i.e., the older children with TBI performed worse than the younger children
  with TBI). These differences between the groups may be a result of different
  areas of brain injury typically observed in CP and TBI, and the different
  amount of time that has passed since the injury.
