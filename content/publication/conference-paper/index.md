abstract: "There is a growing trend to teach playing an instrument such as a
  piano at home using an automated system. A key component of such systems is
  the ability to rate performance of the learner in order to provide feedback
  and select appropriate exercises. In this study, we expand on previous works
  that have developed automatic evaluation systems for an overall grade by also
  providing predictions for specific aspects of performance: pitch, rhythm,
  tempo, and articulation & dynamics, as well as scheduling what is an
  appropriate next task. We describe how a set of salient features is extracted
  by comparing MIDI performance data of three piano players to an ideal
  performance, how the features used for evaluation are selected, and evaluate
  using linear regression how well the selected features are able to predict the
  mean scores given by a group of domain experts (piano teachers). Relatively
  good R2 scores (0.54 to 0.68) are achieved using a small number of features (2
  - 4). Such automatic evaluation of different aspects of performance can be
  used as a part of an automatic learning system, and to help provide learners
  with detailed feedback on their performance."
