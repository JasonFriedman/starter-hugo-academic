title: Optimizing piano practice with a utility-based scaffold
abstract: A typical part of learning to play the piano is the progression
  through a series of practice units that focus on individual dimensions of the
  skill, such as hand coordination, correct posture, or correct timing. Ideally,
  a focus on a particular practice method should be made in a way to maximize
  the learner's progress in learning to play the piano. Because we each learn
  differently, and because there are many choices for possible piano practice
  tasks and methods, the set of practice tasks should be dynamically adapted to
  the human learner. However, having a human teacher guide individual practice
  is not always feasible since it is time consuming, expensive, and not always
  available. Instead, we suggest to optimize in the space of practice methods,
  the so-called practice modes. The proposed optimization process takes into
  account the skills of the individual learner and their history of learning. In
  this work we present a modeling framework to guide the human learner through
  the learning process by choosing practice modes that have the highest expected
  utility (i.e., improvement in piano playing skill). To this end, we propose a
  human learner utility model based on a Gaussian process, and exemplify the
  model training and its application for practice scaffolding on an example of
  simulated human learners.
