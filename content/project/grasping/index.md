title: Grasping

summary: "The human hand has amazing abilities to grasp and dexterously
  manipulate objects, which until today have not been reproduced using robotic
  hands. My research has looked at some of the ways we exploit the redundancy in
  the human hand (in that we have more degrees of freedom than necessary) to
  successfully use our hands. I have looked at the kinematics (movements) of
  grasping: how the grasps we select are affected by the task ([Friedman &
  Flash, 2007](http://refbase.nfshost.com/show.php?record=14)), and the
  trajectories we choose when grasping ([Friedman & Flash,
  2009](http://refbase.nfshost.com/show.php?record=17)). I have also looked at
  how we coordinate forces during grasping ([Friedman, Latash & Zatsiorsky,
  2009](http://refbase.nfshost.com/show.php?record=16), [Latash et al.
  2010](http://refbase.nfshost.com/show.php?record=19)) and how the variance is
  coordinated when using multiple fingers during force production ([Kapur et
  al., 2010](http://refbase.nfshost.com/show.php?record=20), [Friedman et al.,
  2009](http://refbase.nfshost.com/show.php?record=15)). We have also examined
  how this coordination develops in typically developing children ([Shaklai et
  al., 2017](http://refbase.nfshost.com/show.php?record=86)) and children with
  cerebral palsy and acquired brain injury ([Mimouni-Bloch et al.,
  2010](http://refbase.nfshost.com/show.php?record=119))."
