summary: While typically developing individuals show movements that are optimal
  in some way (e.g. [Friedman & Flash,
  2009](http://refbase.nfshost.com/show.php?record=17)), in individuals with
  motor disorders, we observe movements that are clearly not optimal. In this
  research area, I am developing models that are capable of producing movements
  that look like movements produced in motor disorders, in order to help
  understand the underlying causes of the movement difficulties.
