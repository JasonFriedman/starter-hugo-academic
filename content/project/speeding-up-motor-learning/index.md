title: Speeding up motor learning
date: 2023-08-23T06:36:19.261Z
summary: >
  I have performed a number of studies looking at how we can enhance motor
  learning, in typically developing populations, and in populations with motor
  disorders. I have examined questions of what sort of feedback is optimal to
  use, the effect of posture and how timing affects the process of motor
  learning. For example, how does learning a second sequence interference with
  the first sequence ([Friedman & Korman,
  2017](http://refbase.nfshost.com/show.php?record=83)), how does observing an
  expert aid in motor learning  ([Friedman & Korman,
  2019](http://refbase.nfshost.com/show.php?record=94)), how can analogies speed
  up motor learning ([Zacks & Friedman,
  2020](http://refbase.nfshost.com/show.php?record=105)), and what is the effect
  of increasing variability on learning? ([Friedman et al.,
  2022](http://refbase.nfshost.com/show.php?record=115))
